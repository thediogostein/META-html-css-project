# Project for the course HTML and CSS in depth, course 4 of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.

This is the website I built as an assignment for the HTML and CSS in depth course. The website is a simple yet elegant design that showcases the skills I have learned during the course. The website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Lessons Learned

During the development of this website, I was challenged to use CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Media Queries to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. It was an exciting learning experience, and I loved every moment of it. I gained valuable knowledge and skills that I can now apply to future projects.

## CREDITS

### Design

I used Figma to design the website. Figma is a popular design tool that allowed me to create the layout, typography, and color scheme for the website.
